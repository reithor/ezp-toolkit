Using image placeholder
=======================

If you want to run a site, but don't have space available for all the images, you may use
the generic image placeholder as documented here: https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/guide/images/#genericprovider

Here is config for 2.5 and 3.x
For 3.x the font should be placed in src/font/OpenSans-Bold.ttf ( or some other applicable place ), not in app/Resources.
Remeber to change ezplatform.yml accordingly when using 3.x
